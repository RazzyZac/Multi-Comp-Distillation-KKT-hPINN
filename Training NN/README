After generating data points with the Simulating Data code, this code then trains the neural network to provide to the formulation. The neural network being trained has the inputs: [feed flow butane, feed flow pentane, feed flow hexane, distillate rate, reflux ratio] and the outputs [Distillate flow butane,Distillate flow pentane,Distillate flow hexane,Investment Cost,Operating Cost]. KKThPINN being trained has the same inputs and the outputs [Distillate flow butane, Distillate flow pentane, Distillate flow hexane, Bottom flow butane, Bottom flow pentane, Bottom flow hexane, Investment Cost, Operating Cost]

The "dataframe creation" notebook is for creating the dataframe that will be used in training and for scaling in the formulation. After creating the dataframe you can use "NN Training" to train the standard feed forward neural network and "KKT-hPINN Training" for the KKT-hPINN architecture. The KKT-hPINN code is slightly modified code from the KKThPINN github directly in li-group. Because of that there are lots of functions that aren't important for this project. For this project stick with --model KKThPINN. If you're using this code on a custom project you'll have to create a new class in utils similar to "Nonsharp_Dist" with the embedded A, B, and b matrices.
